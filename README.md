# ADAS

### Using YOLO for ADAS and Autonomous Driving

### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a novel, robust data fusion algorithm that integrates data from camera, radar, and lidar sensors using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. The algorithm aims to enhance the performance of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) technologies by improving the accuracy and reliability of object detection, tracking, and environment mapping.
